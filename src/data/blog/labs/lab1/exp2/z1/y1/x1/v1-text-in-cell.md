## Experiment 2: Text in cell x1 of y1 of z1

See below the folders image for experiments 1 and 2.

Another equivalent short format could be tZ/rY/cX similar to the RC cell reference format in spreadsheets - with:
- t for tab
- r for row
- c for cell

For now, I'll keep XYZ as it seems to be a term more popular in web usage than TRC or CRT.
