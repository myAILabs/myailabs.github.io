## Motivation

Facilitating rapid development and monitoring of AI Agents and traction-oriented Biz-Ops-Pay engines for the AI Economy

## Overview

Custom 2x2 and 3x3 tab views should help AI Agent owners to quickly understand the agent status and context (in dev or monetization stage) and take action.

## List of Experiments

- 1. 3x3 AI Agent tab view for 4k TVs
- 2. 2x2 AI Agent tab view for 1080p monitors

### Exp. 1: 3x3 Agent status view for 4k monitors

In this experiment, we select the first 9 tabs of an XYZ AI Agent and build manually a 3x3 image view.

### Exp. 2: 2x2 Agent status view for 1080p monitors

Here we select the first 4 tabs of an XYZ AI Agent and build manually a 2x2 image view.
